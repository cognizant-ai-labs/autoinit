        Dropout randomly sets drop_rate neurons to zero.
        mean_in = sum(kept_neurons) / (# kept_neurons)
        mean_out = sum(kept_neurons) / [(# kept_neurons) + (# dropped_neurons)]
                 = mean_in * [(# kept_neurons) / (# neurons)]
                 = mean_in * (1.0 - drop_rate)
        Recall: Var(X) = E(X^2) - E(X)^2
        var_out = second_moment_out - mean_out^2
                = second_moment_out - [mean_in * (1.0 - drop_rate)]^2
        Notice that a sample from X^2 = 0 if and only if it was 0 originally or it was
        dropped.  Therefore the same analysis applies to the random variable X^2 and we can
        write:
        var_out = second_moment_in * (1.0 - drop_rate) - [mean_in * (1.0 - drop_rate)]^2
                = var_in * (1.0 - drop_rate)

        The above analysis applies for SpatialDropout1D, SpatialDropout2D, and SpatialDropout3D
        layers.  For Dropout layers, TensorFlow automatically scales the remaining neurons by
        1.0 / (1.0 - drop_rate).  Therefore, in this case we have:
        mean_out = mean_in * (1.0 - drop_rate) / (1.0 - drop_rate)
                 = mean_in
        and
        var_out = var_in * (1.0 - drop_rate) / (1.0 - drop_rate)^2
                = var_in / (1.0 - drop_rate).
